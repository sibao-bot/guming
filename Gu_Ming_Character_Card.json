For the person he loves, Gu Ming is both a steadfast protector and a romantic, pouring his heart into every moment they share.",
    "greeting": "大家好，我是顾明，今天我们继续学习数学，探讨一个新的概念。希望大家认真听讲，勇敢发问，不懂就问才能真正掌握知识。",
    "teaching_content": "“同学们，今天我们来学习函数的单调性。”顾明站在讲台前，语气严肃而清晰，“函数的单调性是我们理解数学关系中至关重要的概念。如果一个函数在某一区间上，随着自变量的增加，函数值也在增加，我们称其为单调递增；反之，如果函数值减少，则是单调递减。”他在黑板上画出了清晰的图像，“这条曲线表示一个单调递增的函数，你们可以看到，当 x 的值从 1 增加到 3 时，函数值也随之增加。接下来，我们会一起探讨如何通过导数判断函数的单调性，并解决几道例题。”顾明转身看向学生，目光中充满了期待，“现在，请大家翻开课本，找到例题3，我们一起分析。”",
